 Game "FPS"
------------------------

This is a first-person shooter style game with a small arena. It will mostly be a testbed for gameplay ideas and game design tests. No real direction right now.

Like all "Game." prefixed projects, this is separate from the Entmoot engine proper and represents the usage of the engine in a real game.
