 Debug Networking Tester (WinForms)
------------------------

This is a specific test project used to test and debug the networking aspect of Entmoot by using a WinForms app to be able
to step through the various ticks of both client and server. This is very useful to test things like client side interpolation
and prediction by manually moving forward each side's simulation

Like all "Debug." prefixed projects, this is not a real game but a sandbox to test and debug various aspect of the engine.
