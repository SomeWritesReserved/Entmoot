 Debug Networking Tester (3D)
------------------------

This is a specific test project used to test the networking aspect of Entmoot in a real game environment. The 3D rendering
is not the focus here, it is enough to get something on screen just to get client visuals running. This has a real-time
graph to plot data rate each tick. This project is useful to see if any network decisions have any unintended consequences
in a real-time application (as opposed to the WinForms net test debugger which is manually stepped).

Like all "Debug." prefixed projects, this is not a real game but a sandbox to test and debug various aspect of the engine.
