 Game "Zombtown"
------------------------

This is a top-down shooter style game with a large city full of some sort of zombie things. This is largely a re-implementation of the old
"2DSurvival" game from many years ago, but in Entmoot to test out the engine and networking.

Like all "Game." prefixed projects, this is separate from the Entmoot engine proper and represents the usage of the engine in a real game.
